# 🔧 FIX GMAIL AUTHENTICATION ERROR

## The Error:
"Username and Password not accepted" - Gmail is rejecting your credentials.

## Common Causes:
1. ❌ App Password is incorrect or has spaces
2. ❌ EMAIL_USER doesn't match the Gmail account that generated the App Password
3. ❌ 2-Step Verification not enabled
4. ❌ App Password was revoked or expired

## ✅ SOLUTION: Regenerate App Password

### Step 1: Delete Old App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Find the "AURA FX" app password
3. Click the **trash icon** to delete it

### Step 2: Generate NEW App Password
1. Still on: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Click **"Select app"** → Choose **"Mail"**
3. Click **"Select device"** → Choose **"Other (Custom name)"**
4. Type: **"AURA FX"** (or any name)
5. Click **"Generate"**
6. **COPY the NEW 16-character password** immediately
   - It looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **Remove ALL spaces** when using it: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 3: Update Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select **"aura-fx"** project
3. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **UPDATE EMAIL_PASS:**
   - Find `EMAIL_PASS` variable
   - Click **"Edit"** (or delete and recreate)
   - **Value:** Paste the NEW App Password (NO SPACES!)
   - Example: `abcdefghijklmnop` (16 characters, no spaces)
   - **Environments:** ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
   - Click **"Save"**

5. **VERIFY EMAIL_USER:**
   - Make sure `EMAIL_USER` is the EXACT Gmail address
   - The one you used to generate the App Password
   - Example: `shubzfx@gmail.com` (exact match, no typos)

### Step 4: REDEPLOY (CRITICAL!)
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for completion

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to your website
2. Try signing up
3. Should work now! ✅

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

2. **App Password Format:**
   - Must be exactly 16 characters
   - NO spaces when entering in Vercel
   - Copy directly from Google (don't type manually)

3. **Email Address:**
   - Must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive for the part before @)
   - No extra spaces
   - Full email: `yourname@gmail.com`

4. **Vercel Variables:**
   - Check for hidden characters or spaces
   - Delete and recreate if unsure
   - Make sure they're in ALL environments

## 🔄 Alternative: Use a Different Gmail Account

If the current account keeps having issues:
1. Use a different Gmail account
2. Enable 2-Step Verification on that account
3. Generate App Password for that account
4. Update EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in Vercel
5. Redeploy

**The App Password you provided might have been:**
- Copied incorrectly
- Has hidden characters
- Was revoked by Google
- Doesn't match the EMAIL_USER

**Best solution: Generate a fresh one and update Vercel!**
