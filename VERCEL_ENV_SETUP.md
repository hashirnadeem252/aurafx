# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Add OpenAI API Key to Vercel

Your OpenAI API key needs to be added to Vercel environment variables for the Premium AI to work in production.

## Steps to Add API Key:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your AURA FX project

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar

3. **Add OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED):**
   - Click "Add New"
   - **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** (Get from `API_KEYS_SECURE.md` or `.env.local` - do NOT commit this value)
   - **Environment:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"
   
   **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The API key is stored in `API_KEYS_SECURE.md` (gitignored) for your reference. Copy it from there.

4. **Phone verification (Twilio Verify – REQUIRED for signup):**
   - Sign up uses email + phone verification. Phone codes are sent via **Twilio Verify** (works for UK, US, India, 180+ countries – no purchased number needed).
   - **Keys:** `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`
   - **Setup:** Go to [Twilio Console → Verify → Services](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/verify/services)
     - Click "Create new"
     - Name it "AURA FX" (or any name)
     - Copy the Service SID (starts with `VA...`)
   - Add to Vercel: `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` = your Service SID
   - **Environment:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

5. **JWT_SECRET (REQUIRED for production – stops auth warnings and secures tokens):**
   - **Key:** `JWT_SECRET`
   - **Value:** A long random string (at least 16 characters). Generate one with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
   - **Environment:** Production (and Preview/Development if you want full auth there too)
   - If this is not set, Vercel logs will show: "JWT_SECRET not set or too short - auth verification degraded." and token signing falls back to an insecure legacy mode. Set it in Vercel to remove the warning and enable secure HMAC-SHA256 signing.

6. **Redeploy:**
   - After adding the variable, go to "Deployments"
   - Click the three dots on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Or push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy

## Verify It's Working:

1. After redeploy, test the Premium AI:
   - Log in as a premium user
   - Navigate to "Premium AI" in navbar
   - Ask a question
   - Should get AI response

## Security Notes:

- ✅ API key is stored locally in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- ✅ API key is documented in `API_KEYS_SECURE.md` (gitignored)
- ⚠️ **MUST ADD TO VERCEL** for production to work
- ⚠️ Never commit API keys to Git (already protected)
- ✅ Set **JWT_SECRET** in Vercel (min 16 chars) to remove auth warnings and secure token signing

## Current Status:

- ✅ Local development: Ready (`.env.local` created)
- ⚠️ Production: **NEEDS VERCEL ENV VARIABLES** (OPENAI_API_KEY and JWT_SECRET recommended)
- ✅ Git protection: All key files are gitignored
- ✅ Token system: Set JWT_SECRET in Vercel for production to enable secure signing and clear log warnings
