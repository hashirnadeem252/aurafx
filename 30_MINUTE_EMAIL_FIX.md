## What's Broken:
- Signups (email verification)

✅ **5 minutes** to set it up
✅ **2 minutes** to add to Vercel
✅ **3 minutes** to redeploy

## STEP 1: Get Gmail App Password (5 minutes)

### Option A: If you already have 2-Step Verification enabled
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

3. Click **"Select device"** → Choose **"Other (Custom name)"**
4. Type: **"AURA FX"**
5. Click **"Generate"**
6. **COPY the 16-character password** (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
7. **Remove all spaces** when you use it (should be: `abcdefghijklmnop`)

### Option B: If you DON'T have 2-Step Verification
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Click **"2-Step Verification"**
3. Click **"Get Started"** and follow the prompts
4. Once enabled, go back to Step 1 Option A above

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You need 2-Step Verification enabled to create App Passwords!

## STEP 2: Add to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your **"aura-fx"** project

2. **Go to Environment Variables:**
   - Click **"Settings"** (top menu)
   - Click **"Environment Variables"** (left sidebar)

3. **Add EMAIL_USER:**
   - Click **"Add New"**
   - **Key:** `EMAIL_USER`
   - **Value:** Your Gmail address (e.g., `shubzfx@gmail.com`)
   - **Environments:** ✅ Check ALL THREE:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Preview  
     - ✅ Development
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Add EMAIL_PASS:**
   - Click **"Add New"** again
   - **Key:** `EMAIL_PASS`
   - **Value:** The 16-character App Password (NO SPACES!)
     - Example: `abcdefghijklmnop`
   - **Environments:** ✅ Check ALL THREE:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Preview
     - ✅ Development
   - Click **"Save"**

---

## STEP 3: Redeploy (3 minutes)

1. **Go to Deployments:**
   - Click **"Deployments"** tab (top menu)
   - Find the **latest deployment** (should be at the top)

2. **Redeploy:**
   - Click the **"..."** (three dots) menu on the latest deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**
   - Click **"Redeploy"** again to confirm
   - **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

3. **Verify:**
   - Once deployment shows "Ready" ✅
   - Go to your website
   - Try signing up with a test email
   - You should receive a verification email!

## ✅ CHECKLIST:

- [ ] Gmail 2-Step Verification enabled
- [ ] Gmail App Password generated (16 characters)
- [ ] EMAIL_USER added to Vercel (all environments)
- [ ] EMAIL_PASS added to Vercel (all environments, no spaces!)
- [ ] Project redeployed
- [ ] Tested signup - received verification email

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### "App passwords not available"
→ You need to enable 2-Step Verification first!

### "Email still not working after redeploy"
→ Double-check:
- App Password has NO spaces (16 characters total)
- Both variables are in ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Wait 5 minutes after redeploy for changes to propagate

### "Can't find App Passwords option"
→ Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled, then go directly to:
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## 📧 WHAT WILL WORK AFTER THIS:

✅ User signups (verification emails)
✅ Password resets
✅ MFA codes
✅ Contact form notifications

**Total Time: ~10 minutes** ⏱️
